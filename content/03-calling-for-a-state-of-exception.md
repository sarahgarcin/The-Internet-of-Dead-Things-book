Angry Samson

by Robert Graves
 (1895-1985)

_Are they blind, the lords of Gaza
 In their strong towers,
 Who declare Samson pillow-smothered
 And stripped of his powers?_

_O stolid Philistines,
 Stare now in amaze
 At my foxes running in your cornfields
 With their tails ablaze,_

_At swung jawbone, at bees swarming
 In the stark lion&#39;s hide,
 At these, the gates of well-walled Gaza
 A-clank to my stride._

_&quot;Use cunning and deception as weapons, for in the circumstances deceit is no more than prudence, -_Pope Innocent III to Arnold Amaury, head of Cistercian order of monks and the religious leader of the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars. In: John Kekes, The roots of evil, Cornell University Press, 2005, p.13

I encourage everyone to read _The Master and Margarita_, by Mikhail Bulgakov

&quot;_&#39;I beg your pardon,&#39; replied the foreigner, &#39; but it is so. Oh yes, I was going to ask you--what are you doing this evening, if it&#39;s not a secret? &#39;_

_&#39;It&#39;s no secret. From here I&#39;m going home, and then at ten o&#39;clock this evening there&#39;s a meeting at the Massolit and I shall be in the chair.&#39;_

_&#39;No, that is absolutely impossible,&#39; said the stranger firmly._

_&#39;Why?&#39;_

_&#39;Because, replied the foreigner and frowned up at the sky where, sensing the oncoming cool of the evening, the birds were flying to roost, &#39; Anna has already bought the sunflower-seed oil, in fact she has not only bought it, but has already spilled it. So that meeting will not take place.&#39;_

_With this, as one might imagine, there was silence beneath the lime trees._

_&#39;Excuse me,&#39; said Berlioz after a pause with a glance at the stranger&#39;s jaunty beret, &#39; but what on earth has sunflower-seed oil got to do with it... and who is Anna? &#39;&quot;_

Once it was the author or the devil alone to know that Anna had already bought the sunflower-seed oil (and happenings follow) now Big Data in the smart city dashboard knows it too. And much more.

&quot;_We would certainly be happy if we could all get along well together and unite all the forces of anarchism in a strong movement; but we do not believe in the solidity of organizations which are built on concessions and assumptions and in which there is no real agreement and sympathy between members. Better disunited than badly united. But we would wish that each individual joined their friends and that there should be no isolated forces, or lost forces.&quot; – Errico Malatesta_

_ **Timing** _

One of the books that I re-read from time to time is &#39;Jerusalem 1913&#39;, by Amy Dockser Marcus. The description of the intricate processes of entitlements between the different religions in the holy places, are fascinating foremost in the fact that this is such a decentralized and distributed local affair at the time. Equally fascinating is the fact that it was a time, a specific year, where decisions were taking that fostered lines of thought and action so aligned that they became a hegemonic force to the extent the word &#39;inevitable&#39; was forced onto anyone who tried to envisage and build alternatives. 1913 was also the year of the Arab-Syrian Congress in Paris to discuss Palestine, still under Ottoman rule (until 1917, when the British took over until they were kicked out in 1948). Amy Dockser Marcus tells of a telegram from the USA that was sent to the Congress outlining the idea of Jerusalem as a kind of federal Washington DC and lots of autonomy for the various groups on the ground, foremost Arabs and Jews.

_If the Ottoman Empire, or even the nation-states that were carved out of it in the wake of World War I, had been able to allow them to find a way to express their own ethnic uniqueness, practice their religion and culture, and yet still feel part of a shared homeland and a common identity, could things have gone differently? (P.28)_

That telegram got lost in the general dichotomies, and we know what happened.

Today I feel we are reading a similar telegram telling us

_If the nation-states had been able to allow citizens to find a way to express their own uniqueness, practice their religion and culture, and yet still feel part of a shared homeland and a common identity, could things have gone differently?_

_ **What is the cause of the current situation?** _

Paul Du Gay relates, in _In Praise of Bureucracy,_ how entrepreneurial governance became the magic word in the 90s era&#39;s _New Public Management_ adopted in every OECD country, and the EU . It has ten essential principles:

_&quot;Entrepreneurial governments. promote competition between service providers. They. empower citizens by pushing control out of the bureaucracy, into the community. They measure the performance of their agencies, focusing not on inputs, but on outcomes. They are driven by their goals - their missions- not by their rules and regulations. They redefine their clients as customers and. offer them choices - between schools, between training programs, between housing options. They prevent problems before they emerge, rather than simply offering services afterward. They put their energies into earning money, noit simply spending. it. They decentralize authority, embracing. participatory management. They prefer market mechanisms to bureaucratic mechanisms. And they focus not simply on providing public services but on catalyzing all sectors -public, private and voluntary - into action to solve their community&#39;s problems.&quot; (Osborne and Gaebler, 1992, 19-20)_

Reading this list of requirements, we can quickly testify to its enormous scope of success:

&quot;_Because this approach presupposes that no organizational context is. immune from the winds of change, it naturally. assumes that all organizations - whether hospitals, charities, banks or government departments - will need to develop similar norms and techniques of conduct, for without doing so they will lack the capacity to pursue their preferred projects. As Kanter (1990:356) forcefully. argues, all organizations - public, private and voluntary - must either move away from bureaucratic guarantees to post-entrepreneurial flexibility or....stagnate - thereby cancelling any commitments they have made.&quot;_

The one requirement that turned out to be the key element - _They decentralize authority, embracing. participatory management_ – _read the scope of and for identity management_ - is only _now_ being carried out, but only _after_ current and proactive value in the system has been removed from all participants, by the successful operational capabilities coming into play by outcome based competition catalyzing market mechanisms paid for by customers (as the new only role of former &#39;citizens&#39;) empowering specific actors who have executed this roadmap and instead of decentralizing authority at the beginning of the 90s or alongside early 2000s, through identity management, it is only now, after there is no more value in the system, that this decentralized authority is on the market in the form of outsourcing digital identity management in all European countries. Like a snake biting its own tail, but as a a bigger snake, it is then capable of leaving citizens fully behind, not even anymore as &#39;customers&#39;, but purely as entities, dynamically portable parts of &#39;event identities&#39;, thus fully instating the primacy of financial capital as the new political model.

I stand in wonder of how a quote from 1992 was executed fully as a successful political program. This program has left me, a citizen, quite orphaned. I pay my taxes as a good member of society, sometimes up to 60% or more. Before the entrepreneurial program I had a small stake in society, as I helped to contribute to common services. In 2020 I pay taxes to an empty shell for a nation &#39;state&#39; (Emperor&#39;s clothes) that has no more money of its own (euros), no more law of its own (over 90% is from Brussels), no more instruments (privatized), no data (in the hands of GAFA). It still issues me a passport. This entitlement - passage - (for it is not identification) will become a credential soon in my wallet. And as the model of the entrepreneurial state is nearing its completion it reveals it has fully eaten out the state and privatized every and any capability. And citizens are expected to pay not only for this operation that leaves them without shelter and fairness or democracy, but also for a payment to the private sector for the privilege of being able to do so as well as pay for its actual use.

What then is the rationale behind this? What is the trade-off for the civil servants and politicians who are willingly carrying out these operations? Why would an actor coherently dismantle itself, and aim to hide each step from the participants in the model? The reason is that the next phase of a global underpinning of power has already begun to instantiate itself as CPS, Cyber Physical System outsourcing the security and stability of the assets acquired in the last thirty years fully to what is left of state actors – military and especially steadily militarizing police – and the operational capabilities to large private alliances of services (that are increasingly independent of specific brands and/or companies). This is the new program that we see carried out globally, as all &#39;systems&#39; begin to look like each other. There may be some minor cultural sensibilities but that is all. The short emancipation of the individual in a democratic state has come to its (logical) end. From now on &#39;it&#39; (yes it) will be approached at the level of capabilities just like any other good, machine, robot or script: an entity among entities.

_**What can be our response, how can we live as (highly) sentient beings?**_

The course lies as bright as ley lines light up on a summer evening walk. As clear as the dying voice within me, catching glimpses of a clearing of open space way deep into ancient forests and memories of delays. We know what happened. The group of makers, heart of any tribe, refusing to pay heed, respect or alms to the soldiers, priests, sages and kings any longer, disambiguated their organic making practices in order to take their skill: to optimize what is at hand, the operationalize what lies in front and to make efficient what is apparent. They thus took their own misunderstandings and perpetuated them as good practice. This is known as the digital transition. And they have been very successful.

How can you not be if you move with the wind high over houses, roadblocks, cracks in any pavement and men and women trying to understand why wars are raging still? This particular intelligence invaded space, time, speed, scope, yes movement itself even – of any other intelligence. But then again who can say I just want to be me if there is no more dialogue internal to &#39;me&#39; to negotiate with?

As I watch the tiny insect fly of the white porcelain saucer holding my ancient yellow coffee cup, all cracked up, I realize that is probably the perspective that I will be able to give you; very sketchy, extremely poor in perspective and wanting. But I will give it my best.

I think I know what it is all about. I should, I reached the respectable age of 57. Never thought I would make that. Don&#39;t think I was meant too, but here I am. Even if I may not, I feel I should have something to say. At least I found a good lay out. When I see myself typing I don&#39;t feel that void, this longing. to throw up, to stop and crawl back inside my head. The future, any future, was an inch away. My life has always been about and still is, moving that wall inch by inch to feel a bit free, to not feel fear, to not feel longing, to not be uneasy. In various periods in my life ,I thought that one way to escape was to build my own borders, read time frames, so I started drinking, smoking, eating, whatever, only to realize I was trying to control stress by building arbitrary time limits. So, I quit and found a beginning of ease. Most of the time.

The Emperor has no more clothes. We have a three to five year window to squeeze the final remnants of vital energy from the current toolset before every person, not just those who are generically upset, worried and angry by having had to live in Empire for too long - #gilletjaunes, Climate activists, people with different sensibilities - know it too[[1]](#Xc217c44f9d6f9d647df03178eb8b64fb8f54252), Tiggun knew. The role of states and institutional actors is to regulate and fine. These tools have run their course alongside the very institutional actors that legitimized them in the first place. There is no more intelligence in state actors. They are not negotiating with us to move peacefully into a more networked world. Worse, they are beginning to discipline more and more and to see this disciplining as their only tool left. This will fuel more unrest and resentment.

In the current model of representative democracy parties are paid lobbyists of the model itself. We can thus not count on politicians to dismantle the house they built and live in. We should also not be surprised by the current (COVID-19) move towards more control mechanisms and disciplining as these are the tools that are intrinsic to the model. Peter Blau (1956) long ago argued that detailed information that offends or irritates the individual from whom it is requested is exactly the requirement of efficient and effective administration.&quot;[[2]](#X424ae1dfb199fdaa161d17bdce77f94503db3d6) We can trace back the origins of this process of efficiency to Spinoza who considered &quot;human actions and desires in exactly the same manner, as though were concerned with lines, planes, and solids.&quot; [[3]](#Xcd2106d7bad008753f2338f3adbb3432843d57e)

We, citizens, have been in this position quite a few times. At every stage of emancipation, every step along the way - we had to renegotiate forms of conflict deemed appropriate or &#39;normal. In his seminal text _The Social Order of a Frontier Community_, Don Harrison Doyle writes: &quot; The danger lies in a temptation to equate conflict with social disorganization, thereby implying that a normative model of the nineteenth-century community is one, which is fully integrated, where all conflict was resolved through the legitimate process of politics and government. ... &quot;social conflict was normal, it was inevitable, and it was a format for community decision making.&quot; [[3]](#Xcd2106d7bad008753f2338f3adbb3432843d57e)

Social conflict is normal, but currently we are discouraged to negotiate even the smallest of issues on our streets, in our homes, and in our villages and cities _ourselves_. Instead , we are directed to call 911 for any and every occasion. The State has become the new Church, invading every aspect of our lives, regulating it down to the most minute of minutiae. Numerous groups emancipated themselves from Churches like the Catholic one, for example the Anabaptists who after Luther chose for a second baptism to foreground their own personal choice for freedom, in this case, the freedom to negotiate directly with a spiritual source. The equivalent today is to take on a Self-Sovereign Identity. As once people left the Church, you leave the State.

If we manage to win back commonsense conflict management in everyday life as well as agency over energy, we can build a better balance between our corporeal identities and intelligences and virtual capabilities.

The issue is that only a particular subset of the population has access to the data, making them instantly and continuously wiser. The simplicity of the solution is shocking only because of the long and hard tradition of propaganda of vested interest: the wedding of national states and corporate entities to assign numbers and identity to people in passports and goods in IP, barcodes, RFID and all kinds of numbering schemes. States protect IP, corporates do not, or rather did not until now, question the supremacy of the state to impose taxes and building legal frameworks of the (self-imposed) sovereignty of &#39;national&#39; states. Of course not, they are two sides of the same coin.

The solution then is to keep all surveillance intact but open up all data to all. New negotiation tools will then be formed. One of those is disposable identities. This I will explain in the next section.

Tiqqun was also very clear on this in _Introduction to Civil Wa_r (semiotexte, intervention series 4) In 2010 already the group predicted the new philosophy grounding the digital ontology would be provided by _The Tao of the Sovereign_ by Han Fei Tzu: &quot;The way to assume oneness starts from the study of terminology. When names are rectified things will be settled...Therefore he promotes them through and examination of names&quot;. (p.169) Everywhere. The only reason states are blaming the early ones for being so ambient is that they have not caught up yet. In every nation by default institutions are seen as &#39;good&#39; and therefore more data and investigating capabilities can be ported on them. By default, the citizen will be looked upon as more a more a potential nuisance, a potential source of unrest and conflict. In any state, in any iteration.

Occupying the position that names the names is thus the necessary first step to any political agency, it is not &#39;evil&#39; or &#39;good&#39; or &#39;right &#39;or &#39;wrong&#39; in itself, it is the _prerequisite of governance_. Progressives are sidetracked thinking that achieving this position of naming is inherently tied up with notions of control and surveillance, thus objectively siding with those who do.

[[1]](#Xf4c8113f07524640efcbf4d5822e1fc633a9e60) It would be dishonorable and unproductive to fuel a &#39;Revolution&#39; in days of perpetual revolution. From an activist perspective I consider it a duty to encompass moving as much of infrastructural value (as violence filled – resource, moral, ethnic, gender – wise as it is – to a decentralized and fair situation backed by transparency in decision making through inclusive #IoT and AI tuned to the planet, animals, humans and machines.

All you have to do, is stop whatever you do, and stay home for a day or two, stop carrying the world on your shoulder. What we are facing has some coherence, but only because we are the glue performing it. If we stop, it is gone in a day or two. Trust me.

_ **Again, what is at stake?** _

_&quot;Our things in our hands must be equals, comrades,&quot;_

- Aleksandr Rodchenko

All systems are dying. Not a nice thing to watch. Not a time for action either. The situation is toxic. Systems want you to protest, take to the streets, demonstrate. It keeps them alive a little while longer. There is only one way to hasten the downfall of the old order characterized by the state-corporation interchangeability, and that is to break the notion of identity itself.

Identity - as one person credentials validated by an issuer that continuously has access to all relationships - becomes anti-democratic by default.

As at its core it is breaking the relationship of identity as conceived and actualized ultimately by a state, it also means the end of the state as a meaningful model to harness architectures, services and modes of value.

You need to take a big step. You need to accept that this technological frame can only be brought under control by redefining it in its own terms, and so yes this means to perpetuate it by minimizing its totalizing effects. Only then can a way of thinking emerge - as this needs time and we all need to calm down - that maximizes its positive effects, reducing the evil produced by greed, ego and arbitrary decision making.

The basic axiom underlying the conceptual drivers of the concept of identity itself is false. Currently these drivers are situated along the axis of trust versus distrust, as if a precondition to &#39;trust&#39; exists, as if a position exists that can be matched, fulfilled, checked. That position is always empty, temporarily occupied by force by an arbitrary issuer of &#39;trust&#39;, as if it is a product that can be made, achieved, bought or sold. As we are in a time of eschaton, a moment in which the information gathered by sensors in datasets is actuating back into our everyday objects and services (energy grids, connected cars, wearables) this realization - normally dormant in societal institutional practices, temporarily solidified - it was predictable (and predicted) that identity of people, objects and events (formatted templates of behavior of people and machines) becomes the focal point of the new models of governance and the new notion of value itself.

We claim that as long as the imaginary of trust is embedded in the creation - whether backed by religion, alchemy, swords, borders or software - of a solution to that imagined problem: resolving a gap (of trust) no common, no global and no interoperable system of governance can be achieved. Large ecosystems will and are competing to offer trustworthy schemes, but all of them need to occupy the position of first issuer in the first place, the very act of which makes them all vulnerable to moral and ethical blackmail, hardware failures, and software hacks. In our view it is crucial to leave this primordial position open, as it fosters the fallacy of distributing security. In our vision the mental framework in a world of full hybrid connectivity is about _distributing insecurity_ in the fairest possible way.

The key to identity is not trust, but _conflict._ We can describe the basis of and for identity as a space in which two insecurities are at play, termed by Carl Schmitt as the real and the absolute enemy (wirkliche and absolute feind, die eigene frage als gestalt). Intertwined with any form of real confrontation with an outside world that is perceived as &#39;not me&#39; and thus needs to be confronted (real issues), is the basic insecurity of having no validation of existence as him, her, trans self, parents yes, but no ultimate parent. This basic insecurity, not having certainty of origin, cannot be exported to an outside where it could be resolved in a fundamental way. It is ours to deal with, forever. Any notion, form or feeling of trust that we are able to create inside is a result of a mediation, and consequently as it is a process it is bound to move into the direction of distrust, mistrust and breach(es) of trust. This is the default position.

As conflict is the basis of our very being (defined as the space of identity) what we can and should focus on in a strategic, read political (in the sense of organizing decision making) way is _tools for mediation_, tools to work within the core conflict within ourselves and tools to work with as ourselves versus an outside world (other selves).

This is quite a step. There is, however, another step we have to take. If the basis is conflict, always in process, in motion, moving, instead of trust as a potential given, at rest, then we must conclude there is no _intent_ **,** no intention, as this precedes this perceived position of trust. That&#39;s hard. We have build (k)institutional practices and the very notion of the well-rounded personality as a core of identity seeking trustworthy relations on intent, that is conscious and thus accountable actions and activities. In fact, it seems that we need intent to model in accountability (blame and shame).

This modeling has enabled us to penalize individual acts and exonerate large scale effects of behavior like environmental damage leading up to Climate Change and social extraction of resources to inequality, poverty and dissent. If intent is linked to an incorrect assessment of identity, and thus not central to an ethics of behavior, then this opens up an actionable set of actors actually at play in the digital transition (IoT, 5G, AI) namely: objects (with added connectivity like NFC), machines with built in connectivity, animals &amp; plants (as ecosystems) and humans alike , as they can be treated as _entities._

This allows us to focus on the _interplay_ of entities. and its effects on the full ecosystem. Concretely this enables us to make new enablers for governance tuned to a real understanding of technology, its powers and its drawbacks. It enables us to stay fully human yet abdicate from the primary position of meaning maker based on a presupposed feature that we somehow should have, and other actors lack - intent.

_We&#39;re building a domestic army&quot;,_ a Marine Corps Colonel speaks out
# 2
 at a local council meeting about the militarization of our police forces in Concord. He is able to see the same kind of domestic military building processes that he has witnessed in Iraq. He explains how the military works. You set a task and a command. You attach units to accomplish the mission. The key to this is standardization.
# 3
. A friend sends him a picture of himself in a US police outfit that is identical to the one he wore in Irak. In the Boston Globe he relates he saw pictures of Boston Police and Massachutes State Police in the very same combat outfit, just with different names. This first step towards standardizing vehicles and equipment he says is a preparation for a domestic army: &quot;_And let&#39;s not kid about it. We have a government that is afraid of its own citizens. I can&#39;t believe that people aren&#39;t seeing it. Is everybody blind?&quot;_

Our guiding principles cannot be but light and fostering perpetual diversity and/in conflict. Yet, we cannot escape the fact that this rehearsal of 1968 is in the air, present all our around us. I, like Parvus, believe the best course of action is to set a date for the revolution and declare the autonomy of the country country on any given Tuesday afternoon, for if we are right about this, it is truly for us to say. Who are our friends and need organizing first in this transitory phase? We organize along lines of sensibilities. Feelings. Remember them? We make it personal. I have ideas about clans of friends, but I guess we will see them when they see us.

![](RackMultipart20210312-4-3ssohy_html_516082523e9e9a58.jpg)

Can you capture this?

No, this is not COVID related. In fact, I took this picture of my students of the Arts Academy. Sint Joost in Breda on February 5, 2004 in the village of Oosterwijk. We send a press release out stating we – the Pas Op team/Watch Out team - - would come that afternoon. One student had brought some cheap white industrial suits and into town we went. In this picture they are en-route to escort the nice lady in red across the street for although there is virtually no traffic in that small town, accidents can happen, and prevention is always best. We also secured trees and shopping windows without stickers as these are the things one can bump into. A. times we looked up and scanned the skies for satellite debris, so we could warn the good people of the village, but during our stay no debris fell from the sky.

A week earlier the group took the train to Schiphol. One student cleaned the windows. The conductor went ape. Another student brought a small table and a flower vase, cleaned the toilet and installed herself in the small in between space. We had brought bingo cards. We distributed them across the train coupé. Literally everyone joined in and we had lots of fun. Already than the (scripted) chill in. the air between just needed one small match to light it. Literally everyone, but one person, a security guard from Schiphol who filmed us. When we arrived, police were waiting at the station. The conductor complained to them that we had cleaned the windows without authorization.

And two weeks earlier we walked along the perrons of the train station of Den Bosch dressed as a &#39;rookpaal&#39; an item that designated the smoking zone. When I first saw it, I was shocked. To ban smoking in the open-air, sold as a health issue? In 1998, &quot;a Swedish researcher criticized the New European Driving Cycle standard for allowing large emission differences between test and reality.&quot; In June 2016, documents leaked to the press indicated that in &quot;2010, European Commission officials had been warned by their in-house science team that at least one car manufacturer was possibly using a NOx-related defeat device in order to bypass emission regulation. Kathleen Van Brempt, the chair of the EU inquiry into the scandal, found the documents &quot;shocking&quot; and suggested that they raised serious concerns with regard to the future of commission officials: &quot;These documents show that there has been an astonishing collective blindness to the defeat device issue in the European commission, as well as in other EU institutions&quot;&quot;
# 4
And as all of this and much more industry pollution was going on, it was that cigarette in the open on a train perron that was causing all these deaths? To me this smelled of behavioral disciplining. We talked with travelers and asked why they were walking up to these zones, and not protesting the fact that they were singled out from others? Nearly everyone did not care. or was afraid to be fined. In October 2020 the _rookpalen_ disappeared. There is a full ban on smoking now in and around the train stations. It takes about fifteen years to discipline as broad society into accepting the change of &#39;normal&#39; in a very common practice.

So, there we were on that February day. We thought we would be kicked out, shouted at, insulted by the villagers who surely would see the irony, the sarcasm in and of our actions? I mean, there we were escorting people across empty roads, bodyguarding them. Handing leaflets of the &#39;Pas Op Team&#39; asking people to be very ,very careful as anything could happen, anything you know? Instead ,nothing happened. People welcomed our &#39;work&#39;. They did not ask any questions. We were a logical extension of the government. In 2004! In fact, I overheard a daughter telling her mum: &#39;They should have done this much sooner&#39;. That is when we decided to get drunk in a local pub.

Why am I telling this old story? Because I want you to think about what you are up against.

With each outsourcing step along the way of the entrepreneurial paradigm, vested interest trembled. What a hack indeed! You keep claiming about 75% of all money of citizens in taxes (income, VAT, local…) but you can no longer steer on financial arrangements (euro), legal frameworks (BXL), energy, transport (train, bus, planes), health (hospitals can fail)…data (in hands of GAFA) and you have to hide that from the actors that pay for all of it (including your salary). The only way you can pull this off is to align every step that you take to move value out of the model with cosmetic measures that make you seemingly more powerful, so you have to get closer and closer in the face of the actor. Citizens should see you acting out power every day as you concretely have less and less. And what is more logical when you arrive at the final step in the script – as you outsource identity management itself (verification, authentication, signing) – that you offer a vaccination passport with entitlements as a positive way of citizens regaining &#39;freedom&#39;?

Contrary to what you may think, such a course does not require that thousands of civil servants are in the &#39;know&#39; as if there is a &#39;conspiracy&#39; going on, or that COVID is not real or that Bill Gates is behind all of this. No, all activity follows logically from the entrepreneurial government principles themselves. Public officials and civic structures incorporate the mantra that public service is lousy and corporate activity is better, that procedures of control naturally follow from handing over public authority, that having distrust as a default means that you can never be fooled (only proven right), and the logical consequence of this is that around the same time as the &#39;rookpaal&#39; was introduced, Dutch cities started to regulate the bikes in. front of the station and halved the length of book cases in libraries, giving staff a full overview over the entire space. Only old people like me remember that you could get lost in a library.

What I am trying to tell you is that we truly are in a time of monsters, as Gramsci says. What do you do? You protect yourself. You protect your mind. Do you want to wreck it? Be my guest, shout out all your truths. Who will listen? Even if &#39;they&#39; do get it, &#39;they&#39; cannot comfort you but in hastening their own demise, read: lose their jobs, their homes, their families. All that on a hunch that you may be right? No, I don&#39;t think so. You will eat yourself in anger, get depressed or you will lash out and end in jail or a mental institution getting your shot every day. Who wins?

No. You stay put. Read books, Love your friends and family. Run, work out. Get well, Heal. Stay strong. Get stronger.

Your time will come. And. No one will see you coming.

_ **There is a way out. But it is a slow one.** _

We have to break power at its core, that is we have to break the relationship between the person and the number(s).
